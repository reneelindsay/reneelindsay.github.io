As such, your appreciation of morning coffee goes far beyond a functional love—though a nice energy boost does round out your morning—and rests solidly within the cozy robes of ritual.</p> 

		<p class="cityroast">You prefer a medium roast to your bean, both for flavor and potency, opting for South American beans sourced by a local coffee company.</p>

		<p class="cityroast"><img class="gingerroast" src="../images/ginger.png" alt="the ginger tabby looks on contentdly from its cat tree, murmurring a questioning purr in greeting"/>Coffee beans are green when harvested, and nearly tasteless; <a href="http://www.ncausa.org/about-coffee/coffee-roasts-guide" target="blank">roasting brings out dormant flavors</a>. Light roasts are highly acidic and only roasted until the beans expand and crack once, known as “first crack.” The outside of the beans are dry. These beans have the highest caffeine content of all roasts.</p>

		<p class="cityroast">Medium roasts have a smoother flavor and more balanced aroma than their lighter counterparts, with a slightly decreased potency. These beans are roasted to “second crack.” This is the preferred roast for much of the United States. The outside of medium roasted beans are also dry.</p>

		<p class="cityroast">Coffee beans with a medium-dark roast have a slight sheen on the outside, as oils begin to form on the surface. The flavor is richer, the aroma deeper, but the caffeine content is less than a medium or light roast. The darker the roast, the more flavor the beans take on from the roasting process. Medium-dark roasting takes coffee beans to the middle of “second crack.”<img class="glossisboss" src="../images/roasttherainbow.jpg" alt="a rainbow of coffee beans span from green-grey to tan to chocolate brown to a glossy near-black" /></p>

		<p class="cityroast">Dark roast, also known as French roast, Spanish roast, Espresso roast, and New Orleans roast (among others), gives coffee beans a heavy, bitter flavor. Beans given a dark roast take on a chocolate color and taste slightly smoky. The skin of these beans are noticeably shiny, and the potency is the least of any type of roast.</p>
